URSA by Reflectair offers a better approach to upper-room UVC tailored for the COVID era. Our wall-mounted UV light sanitizers are designed to fit seamlessly above your split-system air conditioning unit. This is the perfect position for irradiating pathogens such as viruses and bacteria as this is where the pathogen concentration is typically the highest as exhaled air will be drawn up towards the inlet of this air conditioning system.

If no AC is available, our optional fan-stack module can be added to the URSA unit to assist the natural convection. URSA units leverage this airflow to better scrub the air of harmful airborne pathogens like SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) by drawing exhaled airborne particles towards the light emitted by the UVC tube placed at the focal point of a parabolic reflector, collimating the UVC light vertically to produce superior upper room coverage and intensity by minimizing light divergence outside the upper-room zone.

Over 3 times the UV germicidal power of our competitors at half the cost!

This diagram shows the germicidal intensity (measured in microwatts / cm 2 ) of URSA upper-room UVGI versus a comparable wall mounted unit from a competitor.

> **At a distance of 2m, our competitor provides 85 µW/cm², while our 28W model supplies an impressive 270 µW/cm² – more than 3 times the competition!**

URSA by Reflectair achieves this through utilizing a reflector with a unique, parabolic design. The curved aluminium reflector focuses the UVGI light beam, ensuring it remains in the safe upper room area without the need for power-sapping louvres.

### Superior optical performance

Unlike our competitors' models, URSA's parabolic curved reflector focuses light emitted by the UVC tube, meaning no power-sapping louvers are needed to ensure the UVGI beam remains safely in the upper-room zone.

### Utilizes convection created by AC

By positioning the wall-mounted UV air scrubber unit directly above your split-system air-conditioner (or opting for our fan-stack unit when no AC is available), the URSA system takes advantage of the convection created (cooler treated air is pushed downwards, warmer exhaled / contaminated air rises upwards) to ensure optimal sterilization.

### Cost-effective

URSA's precision engineered design and minimalist approach guarantees maximum upper-room UVGI efficiency at the lowest possible price. Enjoy all the benefits of a state-of-the-art UVC air purifying system at a price-point that makes it accessible for all.

Giving upper room UVGI all-areas access

In the past, given its high cost and the niche nature of the industry, upper-room UVGI lighting fixtures were mainly found in hospital environments, particularly in operating theaters. As with many areas, COVID has changed this. As medical experts play catch up with ever-evolving evidence on the critical role of aerosolized spread of SARS-COV-2, public and private sector organizations are increasingly seeking out UV light disinfection options to bolster their COVID-safe plans. URSA by Reflectair is democratizing the upper-air UVGI industry through its low-cost and flexible solutions. Our simple yet effective units are lightweight, compact and super-simple to install. We emphasize affordability and efficiency while also prioritizing public safety through our smart design as well as practical measures, such as all units shipping with easy to use UV dosimeter cards that can be placed in the room to ensure no potentially harmful UV radiation is present in areas of human exposure.

The end result is a safe, effective and accessible product that you can confidently deploy within your building or facility. URSA upper-room UVGI is perfect for:

* Schools and universities
* Doctors, dentists and medical waiting rooms
* Offices and co-working spaces
* Gyms and locker rooms
* Prisons and homeless shelters
* Elevators and cable cars (smaller versions available)

What is upper-room UVGI & why it is an essential tool for fighting COVID-19

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation, or UVGI, involves using special light bulbs or tubes which emit light at a specific band of the ultraviolet light spectrum, known as UVC. These lights have long-been known to be germicidal, and were first used in the 1930s to combat the spread of tuberculosis. Upper-room UVGI, as the name suggests, involves deploying these lights near the ceiling of rooms, either mounted high on the wall or centrally suspended from the ceiling.

Provided there is adequate circulation of the air, this system cleans air exhaled by room occupants (potentially carrying aerosolized viruses and other pathogens) as it rises up into the upper-room zone, before entering the inlet of the room’s air handling unit (split-system AC, ducted HVAC or otherwise).

### Benefits of upper-room UVC

### Lowest cost per performance

Significantly cheaper than alternative s capable of providing a 99%+ viral kill rate (ie HEPA retrofit)

### Low maintenance

All that's required is a change of the bulb (15,000+ hours) and light dusting

### Easy installation

As standalone units they only need to be fixed in place, connected to power and turned on

### Quiet operation

As an optical mechanism, adds little to no noise pollution

### No pressure drop

Unlike HEPA, upper-rom UVGI does not affect HVAC systems performance

### Appropriate for smaller spaces

Viable smaller rooms like hotels, bathrooms, even elevators & vehicles!

![UVC light is found between 100-280nm on the light spectrum](https://reflectair.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UVC-Spectrum.png =600x200)**Ultraviolet (UV) light is invisible to humans and is sub-divided into UVA, UVB and UVC. UVC is found within the 100-280 nm range, with most germicidal bulbs emitting at 254 nm.

At this frequency, UVC light has been proven to break down the DNA and RNA of micro-organisms, meaning they cannot replicate and cause diseases to spread.**

Bodies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have [recognized the dangers of increased risk of transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html) of viruses like Coronavirus posed by crowded indoor environments, especially when ventilation is poor. [ASHRAE recommends the use upper-room UVC](https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/ashrae%20journal/2020journaldocuments/72-74_ieq_schoen.pdf) sterilization in high-density spaces as an effective tool available to businesses and other organizations as they seek to maintain operations while also protecting their staff, students, clientele, and other building occupants.
