Microporous Polymer UVC Solutions for HVAC

Reflectair leverages the unique properties of a highly reflective, microporous polymer that massively increases the germicidal efficacy of UVC lamps, revolutionizing existing approaches to air purification in HVAC systems.

Absolute reflectivity of a material indicates how much light energy is reflected (or ‘bounced’) and how much is lost to adsorption. For UVC germicidal light (254 nm) Aluminium has an absolute reflectivity of \~70% (30% lost to adsorption). Our micro PTFE has a rating of **97%** (only 3% adsorption loss).

Utilizing an ultra-reflective polymer provides an exponential improvement in germicidal efficacy of our product vs traditional in-duct UVC lights for HVAC systems made of aluminium or stainless steel. This is because it significantly boosts the number of effective ‘bounces’ the UVC light makes.

### Ultra reflective micro PTFE = UVC intensity over 10x Aluminium

In the past, polished aluminium was the industry-standard material for lining UVC disinfection chambers. Then we discovered that using a microporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane could achieve far superior results, magnifying UV germicidal intensity by as much as 10 times!

  
**A 70% reflective lining used in a UVC disinfection chamber (e.g. aluminium) will only manage 2 to 3 bounces before the energy of the light emitted is reduced to 40% of its initial level. By contrast, our micro PTFE polymer can bounce UVC light over 40 times before the energy is reduced to the same level!**
