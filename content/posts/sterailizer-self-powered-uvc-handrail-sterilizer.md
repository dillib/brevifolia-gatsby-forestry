Handrails on escalators and travelators are frequent touchpoints that require regular disinfection to prevent the spread of diseases. Sterailizer makes it easier and more affordable than ever to ensure 24/7 handrail sterilization by utilizing UVC germicidal lamps within a secure enclosure that can attach to nearly any escalator model. Containing twin UVC fluorescent tubes that are powered by a dynamo moved by the escalatorâ€™s handrail, it requires no power source and the only maintenance involved is changing the tubes after 50,000+ hours.
